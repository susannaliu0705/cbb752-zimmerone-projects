## General Course Policy

### First Meeting
The first lecture will be held on Mon. Jan 13, 2020. Somewhat confusingly, Friday, January 17th has been declared an "academic Monday" due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day (01/20/2020), and so the course's **third** meeting will be on Friday, January 17th.

### Snow Days (general policy)
We have built into the class schedule the potential for snow days. To avoid last minute uncertainty and confusion, we will not wait until Yale officially closes the university for snow (which only happens in the most extreme of blizzards). If the weather looks particularly problematic a few days before (e.g., on Sat. for a Mon. class), we will preemptively cancel via the class email list, which means it important for all to be on this list.

### Grading Policy
We expect that this year the weighting scheme will be to a first approximation:

| Category	| % of Total Grade |
|---|---|
| Discussion Section | 30% |
| Midterm Quiz       | 15% |
| Homework 1         | 10% |
| Homework 2         | 15% |
| Final Project	     | 30% |

## Plagiarism

Below is a message from the Dean of Yale College about citing your references and sources of information and plagiarism:

*" You need to cite all sources used for papers, including drafts of papers, and repeat the reference each time you use the source in your written work. You need to place quotation marks around any cited or cut-and-pasted materials, IN ADDITION TO footnoting or otherwise marking the source. If you do not quote directly – that is, if you paraphrase – you still need to mark your source each time you use borrowed material. Otherwise you have plagiarized. It is also advisable that you list all sources consulted for the draft or paper in the closing materials, such as a bibliography or roster of sources consulted.
You may not submit the same paper, or substantially the same paper, in more than one course. If topics for two courses coincide, you need written permission from both instructors before either combining work on two papers or revising an earlier paper for submission to a new course.
It is the policy of Yale College that all cases of academic dishonesty be reported to the chair of the Executive Committee.... "*

*"  Academic integrity is a core institutional value at Yale. It means, among other things, truth in presentation, diligence and precision in citing
works and ideas we have used, and acknowledging our collaborations with others. In view of our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity, the Graduate School Code of Conduct specifically prohibits the following forms of behavior: cheating on examinations, problem sets and all other forms of assessment; falsification and/or fabrication of data; plagiarism, that is, the failure in a dissertation, essay or other written exercise to acknowledge ideas, research, or language taken from others; and multiple submission of the same work without obtaining explicit written permission from both instructors before the material is submitted. Students found guilty of violations of academic integrity are subject to one or more of the following penalties: written reprimand, probation, suspension (noted on a student’s transcript) or dismissal (noted on a student’s transcript). "*

Also, it might be of interest to people, to look at this [recent article regarding academic dishonesty](http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/sep/11/blurring-cheating-collaboration/).
